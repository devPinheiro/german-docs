<p>Using this guide assumes you already have basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript ES6.
This guide was rigorously designed to enhance the learning experience of the reader. </p>

<p>The documentation was designed with the original documentation of each framework, library,
and technology as its manuscript. You might find some definitions to be completely the same
with the original documentation, but there is no better way to teach and learn other than
from the original source: the creators of the framework, and technology. </p>

<p>Some challenges have been placed within the coursework to help you think out of the box.
Depicting real-world scenario, where are you are might have been given a task by your
product team lead, and you have to complete them: make commits and push to the GitHub repo
before getting the next task. </p>

<p>Reading this with no intentions of being an enrolled GERMANSTACK learner? Then you have no
issue completing the task, but it’s advised you to do to you give a working application at
the end of the full docs. For enrolled GERMANSTACK Learners, your GitHub instructor must
have added to a team and have given you some tips on using GitHub and its workflow. </p>

of this coursework. The <b>Breakout Session</b> are moments where the author goes off-point to
discuss some vital information to help you understand better. The <b>Breakout Session</b> can be
skipped, but it’s also advised you take out some minutes to read thoroughly.</p>
