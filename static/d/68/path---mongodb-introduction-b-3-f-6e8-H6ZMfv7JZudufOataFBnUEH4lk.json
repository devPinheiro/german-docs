Let‚Äôs get a quick run through of what\n                            <i>Document Database</i> actually do before we go ahead installing things, we know nothing\n                            about. </p>\n                        <p>Nothing to worry! Document databases pairs each key with a complex data structure known as a\n                            document. Documents can contain many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even\n                            nested documents. Document database takes the structure of JSON, and something a lot\n                            similar to object literals in JavaScript. </p>\n                        <p>Document databases is also one of the types of NoSQL databases alongside Graph Stores,\n                            Key-Value, and Wide-Columns. NoSQL Databases was developed in response to the demands\n                            presented in building modern applications, encompassing a wide variety of different\n                            database technologies.</p>\n                        <p>Most of us with the PHP, .NET Framework background would be a lot familiar with MSSQL and\n                            MySQL which are all relational databases. Relational databases were not designed with\n                            modern applications in mind; taking advantage of the commodity storage and processing power\n                            available today. </p>\n                        <p>Let‚Äôs head over to installation and see how MongoDB is a lot simple to get started with and\n                            add some codes to our previous to-do application. </p>\n                    </div>\n<div id=\"mongodb-installation\">\n                        <h2><i class=\"fa fa-link\"></i>Installation</h2>\n                        <p>Installing MongoDB is a lot more technical than installing Node.

I would recommend heading over to MongoDB official installation <a href=\"https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installatio\">guide</a>\n                            and make sure your installation is work properly on your machine before going ahead with\n                            this course. </p>\n                    </div>\n<h4>üößüößBreakout Session Ahead ‚è∞‚è∞</h4>\n                    <div id=\"mongodb-documents\">\n                        <h3> <i class=\"fa fa-link\"></i> MongoDB Documents</h3>\n                        <p>A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of field and value\n                            pairs.
